# Polished Crystal -> pokeemerald-expansion Port

This branch is the clean base for a visual/content port of Polished Crystal onto pokeemerald-expansion.

## Engine base

- Repository: PKMN2K/pokeemerald-expansion
- Branch: polished-crystal-port
- Base release: pokeemerald-expansion 1.17.0
- Base commit: e8bd1cd7b03fc032ea37e3ecd38b379b5d01a1e7

## Polished Crystal source pin

- Repository: Rangi42/polishedcrystal
- Release: v3.2.3
- Source commit: 3fa43192379df5c3e7b09a08e4d5d79af4f02f42

Do not silently advance this source pin. Any future source upgrade should be deliberate and recorded here.

## Porting rule

pokeemerald-expansion remains the engine. Do not translate Polished Crystal wholesale from RGBDS assembly into C.

Port, adapt, or reproduce:
- authentic graphics and palettes
- overworld sprites and animation sets
- tilesets, metatiles, maps, and collision intent
- UI presentation
- battle presentation
- data/content choices
- scripts/events
- mechanics that are genuinely unique to Polished Crystal

Prefer pokeemerald-expansion's native implementation when it already provides an equivalent mechanic.

## First milestone

Boot the clean expansion engine into a test map that uses:
1. an authentic Polished Crystal player overworld sprite,
2. an authentic Polished Crystal outdoor tileset and palette,
3. one NPC,
4. grass, water, a sign, and a door,
5. correct movement/collision.

No broader game-content port begins until this vertical slice is working.
