# HGSS Storage UI source

This directory is reserved for the authentic HeartGold/SoulSilver PC / Pokemon Storage UI conversion.

## Canonical source

- Game: Pokemon HeartGold / SoulSilver (Nintendo DS)
- Internal archive: `/a/0/1/9`
- Project Pokemon file-system description: "Box graphics (LZ compressed)"
- HeartGold raw archive listing: 87 members

## Conversion rule

The storage UI must use graphics extracted from the HGSS box archive wherever the original game provides artwork.

Do not replace HGSS visual chrome with newly drawn "HGSS-style" borders, tabs, grids, buttons, panels, arrows, or decorative pixel primitives.

Pokeemerald-side code may:
- unpack/convert NCGR/NCLR/NSCR data,
- crop or recompose authentic HGSS pixels to fit the 240x160 GBA viewport,
- remap palettes without redrawing artwork,
- position tiles/sprites,
- drive selection/highlight states,
- draw dynamic text, Pokemon icons, counts, and other runtime data,
- animate authentic UI components.

If HGSS has no equivalent for an expansion-only function, first document that absence. Any derived composition should reuse authentic HGSS UI pieces at 1:1 pixel scale where possible.

## Current status

The existing `src/swsh_storage_system.c` contains several synthetic `DrawHgss...` helpers from an earlier approximation pass. These are temporary migration targets, not canonical HGSS art.

Before replacing them, extract and identify the members of `/a/0/1/9`, then map each member to the corresponding PC/Storage screen component.


## Member mapping workflow

The public `pret/pokeheartgold` decomp currently identifies this archive as `NARC_a_0_1_9`, but does not check its 87 internal members into the repository as named source files. This means member roles must be derived from a user-provided extracted NARC rather than guessed from public filenames.

Use:

```sh
python tools/gen4_ui/map_hgss_storage_narc.py path/to/a_0_1_9.narc --extract build/hgss_storage_members
```

The mapper:
- validates the NARC structure,
- expects 87 members,
- decompresses LZ10 members,
- classifies Nitro formats such as NCGR/NCLR/NSCR/NCER/NANR,
- hashes both compressed and decoded bytes,
- writes a JSON manifest,
- optionally writes decoded members with stable numeric filenames.

Do not assign semantic names such as "box header", "cursor", or "wallpaper" until the decoded member has been visually or structurally verified.
