# Verified HGSS PokéGear sources

## Main app-switch surface — phase 1

This directory starts the authenticity-first replacement of the current
PokéGear/PokéNav presentation.

The live GBA PokéGear currently contains several programmatically drawn
"HGSS-style" panels. Those are not accepted as final production artwork under
the project's authenticity-only policy. Before replacing them, this phase
imports the exact retail HeartGold/SoulSilver source used by the PokéGear
app-switch layer.

Retail mapping is verified against `pret/pokeheartgold` revision
`9d8b7591f09b65804da2fb2dfd56f320633e0d36`, in
`src/application/pokegear/main/overlay_100_021E5900.c`.

For default skin 0, `PokegearApp_LoadSkinGraphics` selects:

- member 48 character graphics for the main PokéGear BG,
- member 30 BG palette,
- member 54 screen/tilemap data for the app-switch layer.

`PokegearApp_DrawAppButtons` then copies that member-54 screen data into the
live app-switch strip.

The three files in `verified/` are copied byte-for-byte from the retail HGSS
decomp/extraction. No pixels, palette entries, tile indices, or geometry have
been redrawn or synthesized.

This is **phase 1 only**. Nothing is wired into the GBA PokéGear yet, and no
legacy PokéNav/PokéGear equivalent is removed in this commit.
